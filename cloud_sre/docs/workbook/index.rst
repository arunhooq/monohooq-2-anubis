CloudSre Workbook
==================

Welcome to the CloudSre Workbook !

The intent of this workbook is to educate developers to move their code to monohooq repo(one repo for whole HOOQ)
and enable them to do Application Onboarding on their own by maintaining their own infrastructure as a code using Terraform and CICD Pipeline using github actions.

Knowledge in AWS, Terraform, Ansible are preferred.

This chapter will introduce you to the basic architecture of monohooq and laying the foundation for the IAC(Infrastructure As Code) and CICD Pipelines.
